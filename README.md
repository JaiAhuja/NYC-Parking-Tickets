# NYC-Parking-Tickets
The purpose of this case study is to conduct an exploratory data analysis that will help you understand the data.

New York City is a thriving metropolis. Just like most other metros its size, one of the biggest problems its citizens face is parking. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and cramped geography leads to a huge number of parking tickets.

In an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department has collected data for parking tickets. Of these, the data files for multiple years are publicly available on Kaggle. We will try and perform some exploratory analysis on a part of this data. For the scope of this analysis, we will analyse the parking tickets over the year 2017.
